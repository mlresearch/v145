title: 'Phase Retrieval with Holography and Untrained Priors: Tackling the Challenges
  of Low-Photon Nanoscale Imaging'
abstract: 'Phase retrieval is the inverse problem of recovering a signal from magnitude-only
  Fourier measure- ments, and underlies numerous imaging modalities, such as Coherent
  Diffraction Imaging (CDI). A variant of this setup, known as holography, includes
  a reference object that is placed adjacent to the specimen of interest before measurements
  are collected. The resulting inverse problem, known as holographic phase retrieval,
  is well-known to have improved problem conditioning relative to the original. This
  innovation, i.e. Holographic CDI, becomes crucial at the nanoscale, where imaging
  specimens such as viruses, proteins, and crystals require low-photon measurements.
  This data is highly corrupted by Poisson shot noise, and often lacks low-frequency
  content as well. In this work, we introduce a dataset-free deep learning framework
  for holographic phase retrieval adapted to these challenges. The key ingredients
  of our approach are the explicit and flexible incorporation of the physical forward
  model into an automatic differentiation procedure, the Poisson log-likelihood objective
  function, and an optional untrained deep image prior. We perform extensive evaluation
  under realistic conditions. Compared to competing classical methods, our method
  recovers signal from higher noise levels and is more resilient to suboptimal reference
  design, as well as to large missing regions of low frequencies in the observations.
  Finally, we show that these properties carry over to experimental data acquired
  on optical wavelengths. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
  consider a dataset-free machine learning approach for holographic phase retrieval. '
