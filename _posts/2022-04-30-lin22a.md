title: Decentralized Multi-Agents by Imitation of a Centralized Controller
abstract: 'We consider a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem where each agent
  seeks to maximize a shared reward while interacting with other agents, and they
  may or may not be able to communicate. Typically the agents do not have access to
  other agent policies and thus each agent is situated in a non-stationary and partially-observable
  environment. In order to obtain multi-agents that act in a decentralized manner,
  we introduce a novel algorithm under the popular framework of centralized training,
  but decentralized execution. This training framework first obtains solutions to
  a multi- agent problem with a single centralized joint-space learner, which is then
  used to guide imitation learning for independent decentralized multi-agents. This
  framework has the flexibility to use any reinforcement learning algorithm to obtain
  the expert as well as any imitation learning algorithm to obtain the decentralized
  agents. This is in contrast to other multi-agent learning algorithms that, for example,
  can require more specific structures. We present some theoretical bounds for our
  method, and we show that one can obtain decentralized solutions to a multi-agent
  problem through imitation learning. '
