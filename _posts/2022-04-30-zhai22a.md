title: A deep learning method for solving Fokker-Planck equations
abstract: 'The time evolution of the probability distribution of a stochastic differential
  equation follows the Fokker-Planck equation, which usually has an unbounded, high-dimensional
  domain. Inspired by Li (2019), we propose a mesh-free Fokker-Planck solver, in which
  the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation is now represented by a neural network.
  The presence of the differential operator in the loss function improves the accuracy
  of the neural network representation and reduces the demand of data in the training
  process. Several high dimensional numerical examples are demonstrated. '
