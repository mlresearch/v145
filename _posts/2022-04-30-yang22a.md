title: 'Generalization and Memorization: The Bias Potential Model'
abstract: 'Models for learning probability distributions such as generative models
  and density estimators be- have quite differently from models for learning functions.
  One example is found in the memo- rization phenomenon, namely the ultimate convergence
  to the empirical distribution, that occurs in generative adversarial networks (GANs).
  For this reason, the issue of generalization is more subtle than that for supervised
  learning. For the bias potential model, we show that dimension- independent generalization
  accuracy is achievable if early stopping is adopted, despite that in the long term,
  the model either memorizes the samples or diverges. '
