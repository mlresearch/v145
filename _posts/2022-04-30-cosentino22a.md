title: 'Deep Autoencoders: From Understanding to Generalization Guarantees'
abstract: " A big mystery in deep learning continues to be the ability of methods
  to generalize when the number of model parameters is larger than the number of training
  examples. In this work, we take a step towards a better understanding of the underlying
  phenomena of Deep Autoencoders (AEs), a mainstream deep learning solution for learning
  compressed, interpretable, and structured data representations. In particular, we
  interpret how AEs approximate the data manifold by exploiting their continuous piecewise
  affine structure. Our reformulation of AEs provides new insights into their mapping,
  reconstruction guarantees, as well as an interpretation of commonly used regularization
  techniques. We leverage these findings to derive two new regularizations that enable
  AEs to capture the inherent symmetry in the data. Our regularizations leverage recent
  advances in the group of transformation learning to enable AEs to better approximate
  the data manifold without explicitly defining the group underlying the manifold.
  Under the assumption that the symmetry of the data can be explained by a Lie group,
  we prove that the regularizations ensure the generalization of the corresponding
  AEs. A range of experimental evaluations demonstrate that our methods outperform
  other state-of-the-art regularization techniques."
