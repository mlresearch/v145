title: Robust Certification for Laplace Learning on Geometric Graphs
abstract: 'Graph Laplacian (GL)-based semi-supervised learning is one of the most
  used approaches for clas- sifying nodes in a graph. Understanding and certifying
  the adversarial robustness of machine learn- ing (ML) algorithms has attracted large
  amounts of attention from different research communities due to its crucial importance
  in many security-critical applied domains. There is great interest in the theoretical
  certification of adversarial robustness for popular ML algorithms. In this paper,
  we provide the first adversarial robust certification for the GL classifier. More
  precisely we quanti- tatively bound the difference in the classification accuracy
  of the GL classifier before and after an adversarial attack. Numerically, we validate
  our theoretical certification results and show that lever- aging existing adversarial
  defenses for the k-nearest neighbor classifier can remarkably improve the robustness
  of the GL classifier. '
