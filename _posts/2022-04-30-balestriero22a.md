title: Interpretable and Learnable Super-Resolution Time-Frequency Representation
abstract: 'We develop a novel interpretable and learnable time-frequency representation
  (TFR) that produces a super-resolved quadratic signal representation for time-series
  analysis; the proposed TFR is a Gaussian filtering of the Wigner-Ville (WV) transform
  of a signal parametrized with a few inter- pretable parameters. Our approach has
  two main hallmarks. First, by varying the filters applied onto the WV, our new TFR
  can interpolate between known TFRs such as spectrograms, wavelet transforms, and
  chirplet transforms. Beyond that, our representation can also reach perfect time
  and frequency localization, hence super-resolution; this generalizes standard TFRs
  whose resolu- tion is limited by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Second, our
  proposed TFR is interpretable thanks to an explicit low-dimensional and physical
  parametrization of the WV Gaussian filtering. We demonstrate that our approach enables
  us to learn highly adapted TFRs and is able to tackle a range of large-scale classification
  tasks, where we reach higher performance compared to baseline and learned TFRs.
  Ours is to the best of our knowledge the first learnable TFR that can contin- uously
  interpolate between super-resolution representation and commonly employed TFRs based
  on a few learnable parameters and which preserves full interpretability of the produced
  TFR, even after learning. '
