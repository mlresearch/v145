title: Practical and Fast Momentum-Based Power Methods
abstract: 'The power method is a classical algorithm with broad applications in machine
  learning tasks, in- cluding streaming PCA, spectral clustering, and low-rank matrix
  approximation. The distilled pur- pose of the vanilla power method is to determine
  the largest eigenvalue (in absolute modulus) and its eigenvector of a matrix. A
  momentum-based scheme can be used to accelerate the power method, but achieving
  an optimal convergence rate with existing algorithms critically relies on additional
  spectral information that is unavailable at run-time, and sub-optimal initializations
  can result in di- vergence. In this paper, we provide a pair of novel momentum-based
  power methods, which we call the delayed momentum power method (DMPower) and a streaming
  variant, the delayed momentum streaming method (DMStream). Our methods leverage
  inexact deflation and are capable of achiev- ing near-optimal convergence with far
  less restrictive hyperparameter requirements. We provide convergence analyses for
  both algorithms through the lens of perturbation theory. Further, we ex- perimentally
  demonstrate that DMPower routinely outperforms the vanilla power method and that
  both algorithms match the convergence speed of an oracle running existing accelerated
  methods with perfect spectral knowledge. '
