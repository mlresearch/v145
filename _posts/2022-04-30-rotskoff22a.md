title: 'Active Importance Sampling for Variational Objectives Dominated by Rare Events:
  Consequences for Optimization and Generalization'
abstract: Deep neural networks, when optimized with sufficient data, provide accurate
  representations of high-dimensional functions; in contrast, function approximation
  techniques that have predominated in scientific computing do not scale well with
  dimensionality. As a result, many high-dimensional sampling and approximation problems
  once thought intractable are being revisited through the lens of machine learning.
  While the promise of unparalleled accuracy may suggest a renaissance for applications
  that require parameterizing representations of complex systems, in many applications
  gathering sufficient data to develop such a representation remains a significant
  challenge. Here we introduce an approach that combines rare events sampling techniques
  with neural network train- ing to optimize objective functions that are dominated
  by rare events. We show that importance sampling reduces the asymptotic variance
  of the solution to a learning problem, suggesting benefits for generalization. We
  study our algorithm in the context of solving high-dimensional PDEs that admit a
  variational formulation, a problem with applications in statistical physics and
  implications in machine learning theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that
  we can successfully learn even with the compounding difficulties of high-dimension
  and rare data.
