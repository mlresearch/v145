title: A semigroup method for high dimensional committor functions based on neural
  network
abstract: " This paper proposes a new method based on neural networks for computing
  the high-dimensional committor functions that satisfy Fokker-Planck equations. Instead
  of working with partial differ- ential equations, the new method works with an integral
  formulation based on the semigroup of the differential operator. The variational
  form of the new formulation is then solved by param- eterizing the committor function
  as a neural network. There are two major benefits of this new approach. First, stochastic
  gradient descent type algorithms can be applied in the training of the committor
  function without the need of computing any mixed second order derivatives. Moreover,
  unlike the previous methods that enforce the boundary conditions through penalty
  terms, the new method takes into account the boundary conditions automatically.
  Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. "
