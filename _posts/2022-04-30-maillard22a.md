title: Construction of optimal spectral methods in phase retrieval
abstract: 'We consider the \emph{phase retrieval} problem, in which the observer wishes
  to recover a $n$-dimensional real or complex signal $\bX^\star$ from the (possibly
  noisy) observation of $|\bPhi \bX^\star|$, in which $\bPhi$ is a matrix of size
  $m \times n$. We consider a \emph{high-dimensional} setting where $n,m \to \infty$
  with $m/n = \mathcal{O}(1)$, and a large class of (possibly correlated) random matrices
  $\bPhi$ and observation channels. Spectral methods are a powerful tool to obtain
  approximate observations of the signal $\bX^\star$ which can be then used as initialization
  for a subsequent algorithm, at a low computational cost. In this paper, we extend
  and unify previous results and approaches on spectral methods for the phase retrieval
  problem. More precisely, we combine the linearization of message-passing algorithms
  and the analysis of the \emph{Bethe Hessian}, a classical tool of statistical physics.
  Using this toolbox, we show how to derive optimal spectral methods for arbitrary
  channel noise and right-unitarily invariant matrix $\bPhi$, in an automated manner
  (i.e. with no optimization over any hyperparameter or preprocessing function). '
