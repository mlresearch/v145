title: Ground States of Quantum Many Body Lattice Models via Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'We introduce reinforcement learning (RL) formulations of the problem of
  finding the ground state of a many-body quantum mechanical model defined on a lattice.
  We show that stoquastic Hamilto- nians – those without a sign problem – have a natural
  decomposition into stochastic dynamics and a potential representing a reward function.
  The mapping to RL is developed for both continuous and discrete time, based on a
  generalized Feynman–Kac formula in the former case and a stochastic representation
  of the Schro ̈dinger equation in the latter. We discuss the application of this
  mapping to the neural representation of quantum states, spelling out the advantages
  over approaches based on direct representation of the wavefunction of the system. '
