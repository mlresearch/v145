title: Spectral Geometric Matrix Completion
abstract: " Deep Matrix Factorization (DMF) is an emerging approach to the problem
  of matrix completion. Recent works have established that gradient descent applied
  to a DMF model induces an implicit regularization on the rank of the recovered matrix.
  In this work we interpret the DMF model through the lens of spectral geometry. This
  allows us to incorporate explicit regularization without breaking the DMF structure,
  thus enjoying the best of both worlds. In particular, we focus on matrix completion
  problems with underlying geometric or topological relations between the rows and/or
  columns. Such relations are prevalent in matrix completion problems that arise in
  many applications, such as recommender systems and drug-target interaction. Our
  contributions enable DMF models to exploit these relations, and make them competitive
  on real benchmarks, while exhibiting one of the first successful applications of
  deep linear networks."
