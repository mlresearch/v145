title: 'Optimal Policies for a Pandemic: A Stochastic Game Approach and a Deep Learning
  Algorithm'
abstract: 'Game theory has been an effective tool in the control of disease spread
  and in suggesting optimal policies at both individual and area levels. In this paper,
  we propose a multi-region SEIR model based on stochastic differential game theory,
  aiming to formulate optimal regional policies for infectious diseases. Specifically,
  we enhance the standard epidemic SEIR model by taking into account the social and
  health policies issued by multiple region planners. This enhancement makes the model
  more realistic and powerful. However, it also introduces a formidable computational
  challenge due to the high dimensionality of the solution space brought by the presence
  of multiple regions. This significant numerical difficulty of the model structure
  motivates us to generalize the deep fictitious algorithm introduced in [Han and
  Hu, MSML2020, pp.221â€“245, PMLR, 2020] and develop an improved algorithm to overcome
  the curse of dimensionality. We apply the proposed model and algorithm to study
  the COVID-19 pandemic in three states: New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The
  model parameters are estimated from real data posted by the Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention (CDC). We are able to show the effects of the lockdown/travel
  ban policy on the spread of COVID-19 for each state and how their policies affect
  each other. '
