title: Multilevel Stein variational gradient descent with applications to Bayesian
  inverse problems
abstract: " This work presents a multilevel variant of Stein variational gradient
  descent to more efficiently sample from target distributions. The key ingredient
  is a sequence of distributions with growing fidelity and costs that converges to
  the target distribution of interest. For example, such a sequence of distributions
  is given by a hierarchy of ever finer discretization levels of the forward model
  in Bayesian inverse problems. The proposed multilevel Stein variational gradient
  descent moves most of the iterations to lower, cheaper levels with the aim of requiring
  only a few iterations on the higher, more expensive levels when compared to the
  traditional, single-level Stein variational gradient descent variant that uses the
  highest-level distribution only. Under certain assumptions, in the mean-field limit,
  the error of the proposed multilevel Stein method decays by a log factor faster
  than the error of the single-level counterpart with respect to computational costs.
  Numerical experiments with Bayesian inverse problems show speedups of more than
  one order of magnitude of the proposed multilevel Stein method compared to the single-level
  variant that uses the highest level only."
