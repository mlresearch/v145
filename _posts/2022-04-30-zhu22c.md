title: Hessian Estimation via Stein’s Identity in Black-Box Problems
abstract: " When only the noisy zeroth-order (ZO) oracle is available, stochastic
  approximation algorithms are popular for estimating the root of the multivariate
  gradient equation. Inspired by Stein’s identity, this work establishes a novel Hessian
  approximation scheme. We compare it with second-order si- multaneous perturbation
  stochastic approximation (2SPSA) algorithm (Spall, 2000). On the basis of the almost
  sure convergence guarantee with the same convergence rate, 2SPSA requires four ZO
  queries, while ours requires three instead. Moreover, 2SPSA requires two statistically
  independent perturbations and two differencing stepsizes, while ours requires generating
  one perturbation vec- tor and tuning one differencing stepsize only. Besides, the
  weighting mechanism for the Hessian estimate is generalized and the smoothness restriction
  on the loss function is relaxed compared to 2SPSA. Finally, we present numerical
  support for the reduced per-iteration ZO query complexity. "
