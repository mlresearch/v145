title: A Qualitative Study of the Dynamic Behavior for Adaptive Gradient Algorithms
abstract: 'The dynamic behavior of RMSprop and Adam algorithms is studied through
  a combination of careful numerical experiments and theoretical explanations. Three
  types of qualitative features are observed in the training loss curve: fast initial
  convergence, oscillations, and large spikes in the late phase. The sign gradient
  descent (signGD) flow, which is the limit of Adam when taking the learning rate
  to 0 while keeping the momentum parameters fixed, is used to explain the fast initial
  convergence. For the late phase of Adam, three different types of qualitative patterns
  are observed depending on the choice of the hyper-parameters: oscillations, spikes,
  and divergence. In particular, Adam converges much smoother and even faster when
  the values of the two momentum factors are close to each other. This observation
  is particularly important for scientific computing tasks, for which the training
  process usually proceeds into the high precision regime. '
