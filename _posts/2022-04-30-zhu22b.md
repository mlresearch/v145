title: Hessian-Aided Random Perturbation (HARP) Using Noisy Zeroth-Order Queries
abstract: 'In stochastic optimization problems using noisy zeroth-order (ZO) oracles
  only, the randomized counterpart of Kiefer-Wolfowitz-type method is widely used
  to estimate the gradient. Existing al- gorithms generate the randomized perturbation
  from a zero-mean unit-covariance distribution. In contrast, this work considers
  the generalization where the perturbations may have non-isotropic covariance matrix
  constructed from the ZO queries. We propose to feed the Hessian-inverse ap- proximation
  into the covariance of the random perturbation, so it is dubbed as Hessian-Aided
  Ran- dom Perturbation (HARP). HARP collects two or more (depending on the specific
  estimator form) zeroth-order queries per iteration to form approximations for both
  the gradient and the Hessian. We show the almost surely convergence and derive the
  convergence rate for HARP under stan- dard assumptions. We demonstrate, with theoretical
  guarantees and numerical experiments, that HARP is less sensitive to ill-conditioning
  and more query-efficient than other gradient approxima- tion schemes with isotropic-covariance
