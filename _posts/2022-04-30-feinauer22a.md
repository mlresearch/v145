title: Reconstruction of Pairwise Interactions using Energy-Based Models
abstract: 'Pairwise models like the Ising model or the generalized Potts model have
  found many successful applications in fields like physics, biology, and economics.
  Closely connected is the problem of inverse statistical mechanics, where the goal
  is to infer the parameters of such models given observed data. An open problem in
  this field is the question of how to train these models in the case where the data
  contain additional higher-order interactions that are not present in the pairwise
  model. In this work, we propose an approach based on Energy-Based Models and pseudolikelihood
  maximization to address these complications: we show that hybrid models, which combine
  a pairwise model and a neural network, can lead to significant improvements in the
  reconstruction of pairwise interactions. We show these improvements to hold consistently
  when compared to a standard approach using only the pairwise model and to an approach
  using only a neural network. This is in line with the general idea that simple interpretable
  models and complex black-box models are not necessarily a dichotomy: interpolating
  these two classes of models can allow to keep some advantages of both. '
