title: Noise-Robust End-to-End Quantum Control using Deep Autoregressive Policy Networks
abstract: 'Variational quantum eigensolvers have recently received increased attention,
  as they enable the use of quantum computing devices to find solutions to complex
  problems, such as the ground energy and ground state of strongly-correlated quantum
  many-body systems. In many applications, it is the optimization of both continuous
  and discrete parameters that poses a formidable challenge. Using reinforcement learning
  (RL), we present a hybrid policy gradient algorithm capable of simul- taneously
  optimizing continuous and discrete degrees of freedom in an uncertainty-resilient
  way. The hybrid policy is modeled by a deep autoregressive neural network to capture
  causality. We employ the algorithm to prepare the ground state of the nonintegrable
  quantum Ising model in a unitary process, parametrized by a generalized quantum
  approximate optimization ansatz: the RL agent solves the discrete combinatorial
  problem of constructing the optimal sequences of unitaries out of a predefined set
  and, at the same time, it optimizes the continuous durations for which these unitaries
  are applied. We demonstrate the noise-robust features of the agent by considering
  three sources of uncertainty: classical and quantum measurement noise, and errors
  in the control unitary durations. Our work exhibits the beneficial synergy between
  reinforcement learning and quantum control. '
