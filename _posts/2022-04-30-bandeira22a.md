title: Average-Case Integrality Gap for Non-Negative Principal Component Analysis
abstract: " Montanari and Richard (2015) asked whether a natural semidefinite programming
  (SDP) relaxation can effectively optimize $\\bx^{\\top}\\bW \\bx$ over $\\|\\bx\\|
  = 1$ with $x_i \\geq 0$ for all coordinates $i$, where $\\bW \\in \\RR^{n \\times
  n}$ is drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) or a spiked matrix model.
  In small numerical experiments, this SDP appears to be \\emph{tight} for the GOE,
  producing a rank-one optimal matrix solution aligned with the optimal vector $\\bx$.
  We prove, however, that as $n \\to \\infty$ the SDP is not tight, and certifies
  an upper bound asymptotically no better than the simple spectral bound $\\lambda_{\\max}(\\bW)$
  on this objective function. We also provide evidence, using tools from recent literature
  on hypothesis testing with low-degree polynomials, that no subexponential-time certification
  algorithm can improve on this behavior. Finally, we present further numerical experiments
  estimating how large $n$ would need to be before this limiting behavior becomes
  evident, providing a cautionary example against extrapolating asymptotics of SDPs
  in high dimension from their efficacy in small “laptop scale” computations."
