title: Orientation-Preserving Vectorized Distance Between Curves
abstract: 'We introduce an orientation-preserving landmark-based distance for continuous
  curves, which can be viewed as an alternative to the Fre ́chet or Dynamic Time Warping
  distances. This measure re- tains many of the properties of those measures, and
  we prove some relations, but can be interpreted as a Euclidean distance in a particular
  vector space. Hence it is significantly easier to use, faster for general nearest
  neighbor queries, and allows easier access to classification results than those
  measures. It is based on the signed distance function to the curves or other objects
  from a fixed set of landmark points. We also prove new stability properties with
  respect to the choice of landmark points, and along the way introduce a concept
  called signed local feature size (slfs) which param- eterizes these notions. Slfs
  explains the complexity of shapes such as non-closed curves where the notion of
  local orientation is in dispute – but is more general than the well-known concept
  of (unsigned) local feature size, and is for instance infinite for closed simple
  curves. Altogether, this work provides a novel, simple, and powerful method for
  oriented shape similarity and analysis. '
