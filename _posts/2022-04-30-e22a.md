title: Some observations on high-dimensional partial differential equations with Barron
  data
abstract: " We use explicit representation formulas to show that solutions to certain
  partial differential equa- tions lie in Barron spaces or multilayer spaces if the
  PDE data lie in such function spaces. Conse- quently, these solutions can be represented
  efficiently using artificial neural networks, even in high dimension. Conversely,
  we present examples in which the solution fails to lie in the function space associated
  to a neural network under consideration."
