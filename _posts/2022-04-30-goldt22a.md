title: The Gaussian equivalence of generative models for learning with shallow neural
  networks
abstract: 'Understanding the impact of data structure on the computational tractability
  of learning is a key challenge for the theory of neural networks. Many theoretical
  works do not explicitly model training data, or assume that inputs are drawn component-wise
  independently from some simple probability distribution. Here, we go beyond this
  simple paradigm by studying the performance of neural networks trained on data drawn
  from pre-trained generative models. This is possible due to a Gaussian equivalence
  stating that the key metrics of interest, such as the training and test errors,
  can be fully captured by an appropriately chosen Gaussian model. We provide three
  strands of rigorous, analytical and numerical evidence corroborating this equivalence.
  First, we establish rigorous conditions for the Gaussian equivalence to hold in
  the case of single-layer generative models, as well as deterministic rates for convergence
  in distribution. Second, we leverage this equivalence to derive a closed set of
  equations describing the generalisation performance of two widely studied machine
  learning problems: two-layer neural networks trained using one-pass stochastic gradient
  descent, and full-batch pre-learned features or kernel methods. Finally, we perform
  experiments demonstrating how our theory applies to deep, pre-trained generative
  models. These results open a viable path to the theoretical study of machine learning
  models with realistic data. '
