title: Numerical Calabi-Yau metrics from holomorphic networks
abstract: 'We propose machine learning inspired methods for computing numerical Calabi-Yau
  (Ricci flat Ka Ìˆhler) metrics, and implement them using Tensorflow/Keras. We compare
  them with previous work, and find that they are far more accurate for manifolds
  with little or no symmetry. We also discuss issues such as overparameterization
  and choice of optimization methods. '
