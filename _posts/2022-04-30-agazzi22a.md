title: 'Temporal-difference learning with nonlinear function approximation: lazy training
  and mean field regimes'
abstract: " We discuss the approximation of the value function for infinite-horizon
  discounted Markov Reward Processes (MRP) with wide neural networks trained with
  the Temporal-Difference (TD) learning algorithm. We first consider this problem
  under a certain scaling of the approximating function, leading to a regime called
  lazy training. In this regime, which arises naturally, implicit in the initialization
  of the neural network, the parameters of the model vary only slightly during the
  learning process, resulting in approximately linear behavior of the model. Both
  in the under- and over-parametrized frameworks, we prove exponential convergence
  to local, respectively global minimizers of the TD learning algorithm in the lazy
  training regime. We then compare the above scaling with the alternative mean-field
  scaling, where the approximately linear behavior of the model is lost. In this nonlinear,
  mean-field regime we prove that all fixed points of the dynamics in parameter space
  are global minimizers. We finally give examples of our convergence results in the
  case of models that diverge if trained with non-lazy TD learning."
