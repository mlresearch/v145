title: Sharp threshold for alignment of graph databases with Gaussian weights
abstract: 'We study the fundamental limits for reconstruction in weighted graph (or
  matrix) database alignment. We consider a model of two graphs where $\pi^*$ is a
  planted uniform permutation and all pairs of edge weights $(A_{i,j}, B_{\pi^*(i),\pi^*(j)})_{1
  \leq i<j \leq n}$ are i.i.d. pairs of Gaussian variables with zero mean, unit variance
  and correlation parameter $\rho \in [0,1]$. We prove that there is a sharp threshold
  for exact recovery of $\pi^*$: if $n \rho^2 \geq (4+\eps) \log n + \omega(1)$ for
  some $\eps>0$, there is an estimator  $\hat{\pi}$ – namely the MAP estimator – based
  on the observation of databases $A,B$ that achieves exact reconstruction with high
  probability. Conversely, if $n \rho^2 \leq 4 \log n - \log \log n - \omega(1)$,
  then any estimator $\hat{\pi}$ verifies $\hat{\pi}=\pi$ with probability $o(1)$.
  This result shows that the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery is
  the same as the one obtained for detection in a recent work by \cite{Wu20}: in other
  words, for Gaussian weighted graph alignment, the problem of reconstruction is not
  more difficult than that of detection. Though the reconstruction task was already
  well understood for vector-shaped database alignment (that is taking signal of the
  form $(u_i, v_{\pi^*(i)})_{1 \leq i\leq n}$ where $(u_i, v_{\pi^*(i)})$ are i.i.d.
  pairs in $\dR^{d_u} \times \dR^{d_v}$), its formulation for graph (or matrix) databases
  brings a drastically different problem for which the hard phase is conjectured to
  be wide. The proofs build upon the analysis of the MAP estimator and the second
  moment method, together with the study of the correlation structure of energies
  of permutations. '
