title: Parameter Estimation with Dense and Convolutional Neural Networks Applied to
  the FitzHugh–Nagumo ODE
abstract: Machine learning algorithms have been successfully used to approximate nonlinear
  maps under weak assumptions on the structure and properties of the maps. We present
  deep neural networks using dense and convolutional layers to solve an inverse problem,
  where we seek to estimate param- eters of a FitzHugh–Nagumo model, which consists
  of a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We employ the neural
  networks to approximate reconstruction maps for model parameter estimation from
  observational data, where the data comes from the solution of the ODE and takes
  the form of a time series representing dynamically spiking membrane potential of
  a bio- logical neuron. We target this dynamical model because of the computational
  challenges it poses in an inference setting, namely, having a highly nonlinear and
  nonconvex data misfit term and permit- ting only weakly informative priors on parameters.
  These challenges cause traditional optimization to fail and alternative algorithms
  to exhibit large computational costs. We quantify the prediction errors of model
  parameters obtained from the neural networks and investigate the effects of net-
  work architectures with and without the presence of noise in observational data.
  We generalize our framework for neural network-based reconstruction maps to simultaneously
  estimate ODE parame- ters and parameters of autocorrelated observational noise.
  Our results demonstrate that deep neural networks have the potential to estimate
  parameters in dynamical models and stochastic processes, and they are capable of
  predicting parameters accurately for the FitzHugh–Nagumo model.
