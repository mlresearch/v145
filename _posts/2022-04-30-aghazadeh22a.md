title: 'BEAR: Sketching BFGS Algorithm for Ultra-High Dimensional Feature Selection
  in Sublinear Memory'
abstract: 'We consider feature selection for applications in machine learning where
  the dimensionality of the data is so large that it exceeds the working memory of
  the (local) computing machine. Unfortunately, current large-scale sketching algorithms
  show poor memory-accuracy trade-off in selecting features in high dimensions due
  to the irreversible collision and accumulation of the stochastic gradient noise
  in the sketched domain. Here, we develop a second-order feature selection algorithm,
  called BEAR, which avoids the extra collisions by efficiently storing the second-order
  stochastic gradients of the celebrated Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon (BFGS)
  algorithm in Count Sketch, using a memory cost that grows sublinearly with the size
  of the feature vector. BEAR reveals an unexplored advantage of second-order optimization
  for memory-constrained high-dimensional gradient sketching. Our extensive experiments
  on several real-world data sets from genomics to language processing demonstrate
  that BEAR requires up to three orders of magnitude less memory space to achieve
  the same classification accuracy compared to the first-order sketching algorithms
  with a comparable run time. Our theoretical analysis further proves the global convergence
  of BEAR with $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rate in $t$ iterations of the sketched algorithm. '
