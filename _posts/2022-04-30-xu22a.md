title: Dynamic Algorithms for Online Multiple Testing
abstract: 'We derive new algorithms for online multiple testing that provably control
  false discovery exceedance (FDX) while achieving orders of magnitude more power
  than previous methods. This statistical advance is enabled by the development of
  new algorithmic ideas: earlier algorithms are more “static” while our new ones allow
  for the dynamical adjustment of testing levels based on the amount of wealth the
  algorithm has accumulated. We demonstrate that our algorithms achieve higher power
  in a variety of synthetic experiments. We also prove that SupLORD can provide error
  control for both FDR and FDX, and controls FDR at stopping times. Stopping times
  are particularly important as they permit the experimenter to end the experiment
  arbitrarily early while maintaining desired control of the FDR. SupLORD is the first
  non-trivial algorithm, to our knowledge, that can control FDR at stopping times
  in the online setting. '
