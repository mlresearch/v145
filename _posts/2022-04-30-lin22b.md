title: A Data Driven Method for Computing Quasipotentials
abstract: 'The quasipotential is a natural generalization of the concept of energy
  functions to non-equilibrium systems. In the analysis of rare events in stochastic
  dynamics, it plays a central role in charac- terizing the statistics of transition
  events and the likely transition paths. However, computing the quasipotential is
  challenging, especially in high dimensional dynamical systems where a global landscape
  is sought. Traditional methods based on the dynamic programming principle or path
  space minimization tend to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper,
  we propose a simple and efficient machine learning method to resolve this problem.
  The key idea is to learn an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that drives
  the dynamics, from which one can identify the quasipotential. We demonstrate on
  various example systems that our method can effectively compute quasipotential landscapes
  without requiring spatial discretization or solving path-space optimization problems.
  Moreover, the method is purely data driven in the sense that only observed trajectories
  of the dynamics are required for the computation of the quasipotential. These prop-
  erties make it a promising method to enable the general application of quasipotential
  analysis to dynamical systems away from equilibrium. '
