title: Implicit Form Neural Network for Learning Scalar Hyperbolic Conservation Laws
abstract: " Conservation laws are critical to our understanding of the physical world.
  Numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws has been a very important and
  challenging task with some difficul- ties such as nonphysical solutions, solution
  discontinuities and shock wave capturing, and a large amount of conventional numerical
  solvers of finite difference, finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin types have
  been developed in the past decades. Along with the booming and great suc- cess of
  deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, many excellent
  works also have emerged for their application to PDE related scientific problems
  in recent years. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for solving scalar
  hyperbolic conservation laws. More specifically, we design a neural network model
  in the unsupervised fashion, called “IFNN”, based on a special implicit form for
  the solution of the problem. The proposed IFNN does not directly process the target
  PDEs, instead it deals with the nonlinear equations characterizing implicitly the
  solution of the PDEs. Numerical experiments and performance comparisons of our IFNN
  with the well-known PINN are performed on two well-known problems under various
  boundary conditions, the inviscid Burgers’ equation and the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards
  (LWR) model for traffic flow, and the results show that IFNN can significantly outperform
  PINN in capturing the shock waves. "
