title: Solving Bayesian Inverse Problems via Variational Autoencoders
abstract: 'In recent years, the field of machine learning has made phenomenal progress
  in the pursuit of simu- lating real-world data generation processes. One notable
  example of such success is the variational autoencoder (VAE). In this work, with
  a small shift in perspective, we leverage and adapt VAEs for a different purpose:
  uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific inverse problems. We intro- duce UQ-VAE:
  a flexible, adaptive, hybrid data/model-constrained framework for training neural
  networks capable of rapid modelling of the posterior distribution representing the
  unknown param- eter of interest. Specifically, from divergence-based variational
  inference, our framework is derived such that most of the information usually present
  in scientific inverse problems is fully utilized in the training procedure. Additionally,
  this framework includes an adjustable hyperparameter that allows selection of the
  notion of distance between the posterior model and the target distribution. This
  introduces more flexibility in controlling how optimization directs the learning
  of the posterior model. Further, this framework possesses an inherent adaptive optimization
  property that emerges through the learning of the posterior uncertainty. Numerical
  results for an elliptic PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problem are provided to
  verify the proposed framework. '
